## 🎨 Customization

- **Text & Messages**:  
  Change the wording in `index.html`, `yes_page.html`, and `no_page.html` to fit your own style.  

- **Colors & Theme**:  
  Edit CSS variables (e.g., `--bg`, `--accent`, `--paper`) at the top of each style file.  

- **Fonts**:  
  Current setup uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):  
  - `Playfair Display` for headers  
  - `Poppins` for body text  

- **Animations**:  
  - Confetti is generated in JavaScript (`yes_page.html`).  
  - Raindrops are generated in JavaScript (`no_page.html`).
